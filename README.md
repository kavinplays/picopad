# picopad
This is a repository where i store files for my macropad made using Raspberry Pi Pico

The picopad has 8 buttons and two knobs. The buttons send signal to Autohotkey which then proceeds to do significant macros. It also runs an application called deej which allows the knobs to be treated with absolute values for master and mic volume.

The files should be placed in the same folder.
