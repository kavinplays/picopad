# picopad
This is a repository where i store files for my macropad made using Raspberry Pi Pico\
The picopad has 8 buttons and two knobs.\
The buttons send signal to Autohotkey which then proceeds to do significant macros.\
It also runs an application called deej which allows the knobs to be treated with absolute values for master and mic volume.

Installing CircuitPython on the pi pico:

You can get the latest release at https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/ \
I have put the file that i used for my picopad in the folder circuitpython incase this version gets deleted or something\
Press and hold the bootsel button and plug in the pico into the pc using a micro usb cable.\
Leave the bootsel button after it gets detected in windows as a flash drive.\
Drag and drop the circuitpython file in it. \
Pico should now restart
